## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the required packages. We recommend setting up a virtual environment.

Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yzzhn/imc2024dnshttps.git
cd imc2024dnshttps
```

Step 2: Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional)
Create a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Step 3: Install Required Packages
Install the necessary packages listed below.

```
pip install jupyterlab matplotlib pandas numpy dnspython seaborn
```

This will install:
```
* JupyterLab - for interactive notebooks
* Matplotlib, Seaborn - for data visualization
* Pandas, Numpy - for data manipulation
* Dnspython - for dns records parsing
```

Step 4: Launch JupyterLab
```
jupyter lab
```

### Usage

#### 1. Visualization
   
Data visualization does not require the download of data. Just launch JupyterLab and run notebooks in `notebook` directory.

#### 2. Download data and reprocess.

Please download data at https://keyinfra.cs.virginia.edu/ and save the data in `data/raw` directory.
Then run all scripts in `src/` to get new statistics.
